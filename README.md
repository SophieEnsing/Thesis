# Thesis

## Thesis subject
For the next three months I will be working on creating a working simulation of public transport in the city of Amsterdam. To evaluate the model, a year of GVB data is available. The goal of this project is to create a simulation that is close to reality, but is also generic enough to use for decision making and planning. To acomplish this, agent based modeling and simulation will be used. The agents represent different types of traveller groups, which have their own rules and goals within the public transport network.
