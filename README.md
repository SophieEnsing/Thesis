## Thesis subject
For the next three months I will be working on creating a working simulation of public transport in the city of Amsterdam. To evaluate the model, a year of GVB data is available. The goal of this project is to create a simulation that is close to reality, but is also generic enough to use for decision making and planning. This can be described as a classic over-/underfitting problem. It might be necessary to distinguish between seasons, but fitting the model to represent every single day would be overfitting of course.
