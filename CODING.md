# Coding

## Preferred way of working
Throughout my Bachlor degree and Master degree in Data Science, I have learned to work with Python for many different projects. Python is a good language to use for Data Science and has been my go to language for years now. I feel comfortable working with Python and I feel comfortable with it. For my thesis at the municipality I will use Python as well. Since I will be working on simulation and network problems, Python and Networkx are very good options. To make sure the end result looks nice, I can also use my experience in HTML/CSS and JavaScript. 

While working on any project my first choice is always to work in a Jupyter Notebook. It's easy to run and very clearly structured. There are also possibilities to run Notebooks in cloud environments if I need to run my model longer for all the simulations. 

## Documentation
One of the most important things to start with while coding is providing everything you write with a clear structure. The easiest, but also really important things to do here are to write clear comments and use very clear and descriptive variable names. The way Python is strucutred, it can actually read like clear English if the right variable names are used throughout all code. This is important when other people are going to use the code or even for people who can't code themselves but want to know a little bit more about what's happening.

## Functions
Before I write any code, I will always try to break up my plan in logical seperate parts. Maybe I will need to use a class structure or maybe I just need a structure with several small functions that I need to combine. Whatever works for the project at hand should be considered. I prefer to write small clear functions where not to much happens inside one fuction. This breaks up the process and makes it easy to reuse functions as well. Python is also a great language to use for list/dict comprehensions. These work efficiently and make sure the code stays compact. It can be a little bit harder to read for someone who is unfamiliar with them, so they should be written well.
